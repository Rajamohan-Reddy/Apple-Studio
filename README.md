### Functionality

#### Must Have

     1. **Apple Watch Studio Landing Page**
    2. **Apple Watch Customization Workflow**
        - Case selection
        - Size selection
        - Band selection
        - Collection switching

### Key Features to Implement


    ### **1. Case Selection**

    - Create an interactive grid of available Apple Watch cases with various materials (e.g., Aluminum, Titanium).
    - Implement hover effects on the case selection grid for a sleek and responsive experience.
    - Ensure the watch preview updates in real-time based on the selected case.
